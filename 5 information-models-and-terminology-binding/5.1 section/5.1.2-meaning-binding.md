# 5.1.2 Meaning Binding

The context in which data is entered or stored in a record affects the meaning of that data. For example, a disease such as "asthma" could be entered as a "current diagnosis", or as part of the "past history", or "family history" of the patient. It could also be entered with an indication of the diagnosis was "confirmed", "possible", or "excluded". These factors affect the clinical meaning of the recorded data, so health records must clearly represent these clinically significant differences. This requirement applies to all types of health records, whether they are paper-based or electronic, and whether they are represented as narrative text or using codes. However, in [electronic health records](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/electronic+health+record "Glossary link: electronic health records") significantly different clinical meanings need to be represented in a computer-processable form to enable reliable reporting and analytics. Furthermore, if the same clinical meaning can be recorded in different [data entry contexts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/data+entry+context "Glossary link: data entry contexts"), equivalence between alternative representations also needs to be computable. The logical mechanism used to address these requirements is referred to as [meaning binding](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/meaning+binding "Glossary link: meaning binding").

# Definition

A [meaning binding](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/meaning+binding "Glossary link: meaning binding") is  a [terminology binding](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/terminology+binding "Glossary link: terminology binding") that represents the clinical meaning of a data item or collection of data items. 

### Notes

  * A _meaning binding_ associates a clinical meaning with either a [data entry context](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/data+entry+context "Glossary link: data entry context") or a defined collection of data items in an [electronic health record](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/electronic+health+record "Glossary link: electronic health record") information model. The clinical meaning of an instance of a data item with a _meaning binding_ is determined by applying the _meaning binding_ to the value or set of values in that instance.

  * SNOMED CT  _meaning bindings_ should be represented by [expression templates](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/expression+template "Glossary link: expression templates") containing one or more [template slots](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/template+slot "Glossary link: template slots") that can be replaced by concepts entered or stored in a particular context.
