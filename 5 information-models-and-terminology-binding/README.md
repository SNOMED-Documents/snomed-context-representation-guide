# Information Models and Terminology Binding

This chapter focuses on **Information Models** and **Terminology Binding** , key components for ensuring the structured representation, exchange, and understanding of healthcare data. It explores how SNOMED CT integrates with information models to enable interoperability and semantic clarity across health information systems.

The chapter introduces **value set binding** , which constrains the allowed values in a data entry context, and **meaning binding** , which captures how context affects the interpretation of a data item.

It also examines interoperability standards like FHIR and compares clinical findings in different contexts, further emphasizing SNOMED CT’s role in facilitating accurate and consistent healthcare documentation.
