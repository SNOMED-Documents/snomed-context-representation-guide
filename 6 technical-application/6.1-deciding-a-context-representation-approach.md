# Deciding a Context Representation Strategy

SNOMED CT implementers must develop a clear strategy for representing clinical context, taking into account:

* The structure and constraints of existing data models
* Cultural preferences and local workflows for data entry
* Alignment with national or organizational standards

\
This strategy must define the division of responsibility between the information model and the terminology model, i.e., which context elements are represented by system fields and which are encoded directly within SNOMED CT concepts.

These decisions impact:

* The design of terminology bindings
* The structure of user interfaces
* The consistency of clinical data interpretation

***

### Context Representation Options

Two general approaches can be used to represent clinical context in SNOMED CT implementations:

* Representing context in the information model
* Representing context in the terminology

***

### Representing Context in the Information Model

In this approach, only context-free concepts from SNOMED CT are bound to data elements. Contextual details are stored in separate fields in the information model.

#### Example Terminology Bindings

* Diagnosis/Problems:

```
<< 404684003 |Clinical finding (finding)|
```

* Procedures:

```
<< 71388002 |Procedure (procedure)|
```

#### Context Fields in the Information Model

These fields may be populated with SNOMED CT concepts representing:

*   Finding context

    Describes the nature of the finding (e.g., suspected, confirmed)
*   Subject relationship context

    Indicates the relationship of the subject to the patient (e.g., family member)
*   Temporal context

    Specifies the time frame (e.g., past, present)

***

### Representing Context in the Terminology

This approach binds to SNOMED CT concepts that include both the clinical meaning and its context, using either:

* Pre-coordinated concepts
* Postcoordinated expressions

#### Example Terminology Bindings

* Diagnosis/Problems:

```
<< 404684003 |Clinical finding (finding)|  
<< 413350009 |Finding with explicit context (situation)|
```

* Procedures:

```
<< 71388002 |Procedure (procedure)|  
<< 129125009 |Procedure with explicit context (situation)|
```

This approach minimizes reliance on custom or ad-hoc fields by using SNOMED CT’s built-in context modeling features.

***

### Pros and Cons of Each Strategy

#### Representing Context in the Information Model

Pros:

*   Greater coverage

    Not all context combinations are represented in SNOMED CT—this method fills that gap.
*   Flexibility

    Allows systems to dynamically combine findings/procedures with context values.

Cons:

*   Higher development effort

    Requires more complex UI and backend design to manage contextual fields.
*   Increased user burden

    Without thoughtful UI design, clinicians may face longer workflows.

***

#### Representing Context in the Terminology

Pros:

*   Simplified text search

    Pre-coordinated concepts (e.g., “History of asthma”) are easier to find.
*   Efficient data entry

    Eliminates the need for separate context fields.
*   Expandability

    New context combinations can be represented via new concepts or post-coordinated expressions.

Cons:

*   Limited context coverage

    Only a subset of possible context variations are pre-coordinated in SNOMED CT.
*   Terminology maintenance overhead

    Requires ongoing updates and careful management.
*   Reduced alignment with standard models

    May not map cleanly to information models like FHIR, which expect discrete context fields.

***

### Choosing the Right Approach

There is no one-size-fits-all solution. The choice between representing context in the information model or in the terminology should be based on:

* Implementation goals
* Data model architecture
* Tooling capabilities
* User needs and workflow requirements

A balanced strategy, combining the flexibility of the information model with the efficiency of terminology-based context, often yields the best results.

Careful design ensures that context is represented accurately, consistently, and efficiently throughout the health information system.
