# Executive Summary

The SNOMED CT Implementation Guide for Context Representation provides essential principles for bridging the gap between SNOMED CT terminology and information models in healthcare. By addressing the challenges associated with context representation and terminology binding, the guide enables healthcare systems to achieve consistent, accurate, and interoperable data exchange.

The guide begins by explaining how SNOMED CT represents context through its “Situation with Explicit Context” hierarchy and contrasts this with context representation in structured information models such as HL7 FHIR or openEHR. It highlights the complexities and challenges that arise when binding SNOMED CT concepts to these models, including issues of consistency, misalignment, and semantic interpretation.

To overcome these challenges, the guide introduces key principles for terminology binding that ensure context is accurately represented and integrated into healthcare information systems. It also provides practical methods for transforming between different data representations, allowing systems that rely on terminology-based context to interoperate seamlessly with systems using information model-based representations

By presenting a standardized approach to context representation, this guide equips implementers, developers, and healthcare organizations with the tools to design systems that facilitate interoperability, improve clinical data quality, and support robust decision-making. Ultimately, it lays the foundation for achieving accurate, context-aware data exchange, enabling better patient care and enhanced analytics across the healthcare ecosystem.
