# 2.3.2 Ambiguous Data Representation

SNOMED CT [concepts](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concepts") enable consistent representation and analysis of clinical ideas. However, the same  _concept_ can be used in different contexts in the information model of an [electronic health record (EHR](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/electronic+health+record "Glossary link: electronic health record")) and, as illustrated by the examples in [Table 2.3.2-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCTXSIG/2.3.2+Ambiguous+Data+Representation#Table-context-examples "Examples of Concepts with Assumed Meanings that May be Modified by Context_CZ:_MZ:_p class_auto-cursor-target_br /_/p_table class_relative-table wrapped style_width_ 99.726%;_colgroup_col /_col style_width_ 15.3381%; /_col style_width_ 18.6916%; /_col /_col style_width_ 45.1347%; /_/colgroup_tbody_tr_td class_highlight-blue colspan_2 data-highlight-colour_blue_div class_content-wrapper_p_strong title_Concept Domain_MN:footnote-ref ac_schema-version_1 ac_macro-id_3ffb06b6-ed72-44da-9564-690a8fcfa270 /_/strong_/p_/div_/td_td class_highlight-blue data-highlight-colour_blue_strong title_Example Concepts_/strong_/td_td class_highlight-blue colspan_1 data-highlight-colour_blue_strong_Possible Assumed Meaning_/strong_/td_td class_highlight-blue data-highlight-colour_blue_strong title_Examples of Context Modified Meaning _/strong_/td_/tr_tr_td colspan_2_div class_content-wrapper_p_strong_Diseases and Disorders_/strong_/p_MN:scg-expression ac_schema-version_1 ac_macro-id_1787cdaa-7721-4c50-a855-a19d67c1fd57_ac_parameter ac_name_HideMark_true_/ac_parameter_ac_parameter ac_name_Border_solid_/ac_parameter_ac_parameter ac_name_atlassian-macro-output-type_BLOCK_/ac_parameter_CP:/*Domain Constraint*/

Therefore, accurate interpretation of an EHR entry depends on understanding both the meaning of the concept __ when encountered in isolation,__ and how that meaning is modified by associated contextual information.

  * **Possible diagnosis** : A note that this diagnosis is being considered or investigated.
  * **Excluded diagnosis** : An assertion that this diagnosis has been ruled out.
  * **Medical history** : A indication of whether the subject of the record has previously had this disorder. In the case of a chronic condition, such as diabetes mellitus, the diagnosis remains relevant but may be distinct from the diagnosis of the presenting complaint.

  * **Past history of a symptom:** A symptom that was present but is not currently present. 
  * **Absent symptom:** A note that the subject reports that they have not had this symptom.
