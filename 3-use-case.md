# 3. Use Case

The following use cases highlight how addressing context representation challenges can enhance data capture, interoperability, and analytics in healthcare.

## Use Case 1: Designing a Data Model for Clinical Data Capture

Establishing a well-structured data model with appropriate terminology bindings ensures accurate clinical data recording and meaningful documentation. This supports patient care and enables long-term health data analysis.

## Use Case 2: Seamless Data Exchange Across Systems

Standardizing context representation allows systems with different approaches—such as terminology-driven or model-based contexts—to seamlessly exchange data. This improves interoperability and ensures comprehensive patient information sharing.

## Use Case 3: Accurate Data Interpretation for Analytics

Consistent context representation enables accurate integration and interpretation of data across systems. This supports reliable analytics, research, and population health management by ensuring semantic consistency.
