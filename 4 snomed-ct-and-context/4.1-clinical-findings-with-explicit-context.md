# Clinical Findings with Explicit Context

## Definition and Purpose

Clinical findings with explicit context refer to situations where the presence, absence, or uncertainty of a clinical finding is documented with additional contextual details. These concepts provide a clear understanding of the specific circumstances under which a clinical finding is relevant.

## Attributes

* **Associated Finding** : Links the situation to a relevant clinical finding or event.
  * For example, the concept |History of sepsis (situation)| uses this attribute to connect to the clinical finding |Sepsis|.
* **Finding Context** : Indicates whether the clinical finding is confirmed, suspected, unknown, or absent.
  * For example, for the concept |No known food allergy (situation)|, the finding context is |Known absent|.
* **Temporal Context** : Specifies when the finding occurred or is expected to occur (past, present, future).
  * For example, |History of sepsis (situation)| uses |In the past| as the temporal context.
* **Subject Relationship Context** : Identifies who the clinical finding pertains to, such as the patient, a family member, or another individual.
  * For example, |Family history of diabetes mellitus (situation)| would indicate that the finding relates to a family member.
