# Context aware terminology binding principles

## Information model-driven vs Terminology-driven Context Representation

### Overarching Principle

* Ensure that the consolidated meaning represented by the chosen SNOMED CT concept and the applied information model represent the intended semantics, and unambiguously declare the context. I.e. the verification, temporal, and subject relationship context.

Below find a set of terminology binding principles, to help guide the binding of specific types of data elements.

## Terminology Binding Principles and Examples

Adhering to these principles provides a robust framework for designing terminology bindings compatible with the SNOMED Concept Model and the structural expressivity of FHIR resources. By ensuring compatibility, we can create a cohesive system where clinical content is accurately and consistently represented across different platforms and applications. This alignment is crucial for maintaining the integrity of clinical data, allowing for seamless integration and reducing the risk of misinterpretation or data loss during exchanges.

Furthermore, this approach facilitates efficient transformations and adaptations in the context of analytics and interoperability. Standardized terminology bindings enable healthcare systems to effectively share and analyze data, supporting advanced analytics, research, and population health management.

### Terminology Binding Use Cases

### 🧪 Measurable Entities

*   **Model Meaning Binding:**

    < 363787002 |Observable entity (observable entity)|
* **Value Set Binding:**
  * Concrete values (e.g., numbers)
  * < 404684003 |Clinical finding (finding)| (when coded findings are needed)

**Examples:**

* **Q: Systolic Blood Pressure?**
  * Meaning Binding: 75367002 |Systolic blood pressure (observable entity)|
  * Answer: 120 mmHg
* **Q: Eye Color?**
  * Meaning Binding: 247030006 |Color of iris (observable entity)|
  * Answer options: < 366031009 |Finding of color of iris (finding)|

**Advice**

* Use _Observable Entity_ for measurable or quantifiable data.
* When answers are coded findings (e.g., colors), bind to appropriate _Clinical Finding_ concepts.

### ✅ Verification Status (Presence or Absence)

#### A. Clinical Finding Approach

* **Model Meaning Binding:**
  * < 404684003 |Clinical finding (finding)|
* **Value Set Binding:**
  * < 410514004 |Finding context value (qualifier value)|

**Example:**

* Q: Menopause?
  * Meaning Binding: 276477006 |Menopause finding (finding)|
  * Answer options:
    * Yes → 410515003 |Known present|
    * No → 410516002 |Known absent|

#### B. Contextual (Historical) Finding

*   Model Meaning Binding:

    < 243796009 |Situation with explicit context (situation)|
*   Value Set Binding:

    < 410514004 |Finding context value (qualifier value)|

#### **Example**

* **Q: History of myocardial infarction?**
  * Meaning Binding: 399211009 |History of myocardial infarction (situation)|
  * Answer options:
    * Yes → 410515003 |Known present|
    * No → 410516002 |Known absent|

#### **Advice**

* When using _situation with explicit context_, ensure the value aligns with or replaces the context attribute in the SNOMED expression.
* Useful for “history of”, “family history”, and other contextual modifiers.

### 🔘 Boolean Questions (Yes/No)

*   **Model Meaning Binding:**

    < 404684003 |Clinical finding (finding)|
*   **Value Set Binding:**

    < 410514004 |Finding context value (qualifier value)|

- **Q: Allergy to Penicillin?**
  * Meaning Binding: 91936005 |Allergy to penicillin (finding)|
  * Answer options:
    * Yes → 410515003 |Known present|
    * No → 410516002 |Known absent|
- **Q: Pregnant?**
  * Meaning Binding: 77386006 |Pregnancy (finding)|
  * Answers:
    * Yes → 410515003 |Known present|
    * No → 410516002 |Known absent|
- **Q: Diabetes Mellitus?**
  * Meaning Binding: 73211009 |Diabetes mellitus (disorder)|
  * Answer options:
    * Yes → 410515003 |Known present|
    * No → 410516002 |Known absent|

#### **Advice**

* If the absence of a condition is implied in your data model, it may be appropriate to code only “yes” values.
* If no explicit “no” concept exists in SNOMED CT, use qualifier values (Known absent).
* Be consistent across all boolean representations by defining internal guidance.



## Deriving SNOMED CT Expressions from the decomposed approach

When applying qualifier values to represent the absence of a condition like diabetes mellitus using SNOMED CT an expression can be derived to convey the meaning with explicit context.

_Example:_

1. **Identify the Concept for Diabetes Mellitus:**\
   Firstly, we need to identify the SNOMED CT concept representing diabetes mellitus.
   * 73211009 |Diabetes mellitus (disorder)|
2. **Representing the Absence/Presence of Diabetes Mellitus:**\
   To represent the absence/ of diabetes mellitus, we need to create an expression that explicitly states the absence of the disorder.
   * Utilize a qualifier value to indicate the absence/presence of the disorder.
     * 410516002 |Known absent (qualifier value)|
     * 410515003 |Known present (qualifier value)|
3. **Creating the Expression:** By combining the concept for diabetes mellitus with the qualifier value for absence, we can create an expression that explicitly represents the absence of diabetes mellitus:
   * Using the concept model for Situation with Explicit context (clinical findings with explicit context)
   * 73211009 |Diabetes mellitus| : 408729009 |Finding context| = 410516002 |Known absent|

This expression clearly indicates that the disorder of diabetes mellitus is absent in this patient at the current point in time or the time specified in the model. It provides a single expression that encapsulates the meaning of the absence of diabetes mellitus with explicit context.

In summary, expressions representing the absence of any specific disorders or conditions in SNOMED CT can be formulated as a SNOMED expression by combining the concept representing the disorder with a qualifier value indicating absence, linked together using the appropriate context model attribute (in this case, 408729009 |Finding context| ). This approach allows for the creation of concise and unambiguously meaningful expressions that convey the absence of any particular condition, all entirely within the SNOMED CT terminology framework.

These expressions must adhere to the SNOMED CT concept model and other constraints to ensure that they extend SNOMED CT in a cohesive and meaningful way, see the [SNOMED CT Postcoordination Guide.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/h8Z6qGxuQrzM9vbx5bPT/s/usjN9isxKh4cLDTFopLg/)
