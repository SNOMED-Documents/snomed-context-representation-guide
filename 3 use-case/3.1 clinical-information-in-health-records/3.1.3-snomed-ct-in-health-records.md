# 3.1.3 SNOMED CT in Health Records

[SNOMED CT](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT "Glossary link: SNOMED CT") is a clinical terminology designed for use in [electronic health records (EHR](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/electronic+health+record "Glossary link: electronic health record")). Some of the features that make SNOMED CT the ideal terminology to use for coding clinical information in health records are outlined below1.

# SNOMED CT Has a Broad Scope

SNOMED CT has a broad scope that is designed to enable the representation of all the types of clinical ideas that commonly require coding in an _EHR_. It is also designed to be extensible and frequently updated to meet emerging requirements coded representation of different types of clinical information that may be stored in an _EHR_. It also enables clinical information to be represented at different levels of granularity. For example, represent general types of disorders such as "heart disease", specific diagnoses such as "myocardial infarction" and more precise diagnoses such as "acute myocardial infarction of anterior wall".

Most other healthcare code systems have a more restricted scope. For example, the scope of [ICD-10](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/ICD-10 "Glossary link: ICD-10") includes causes of morbidity and mortality, signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, and social circumstances that may appear in a health record. However, it does not include normal findings, procedures, medication, and devices. A combination of several code systems may be able to cover the same scope as SNOMED CT. However, combinations of code systems introduce additional complexity as a result of scope overlaps and design differences. Where code system scopes overlap, codes from different schemes might be used to represent similar information. In contrast, SNOMED CT as a single comprehensive clinical terminology provides a consistent way to represent clinical information and enables a common approach to data entry, storage, retrieval, and analysis. 

# SNOMED CT Represents Clinical Ideas

SNOMED CT assigns a unique and permanent identifier to each distinct [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept"). This [concept identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept identifier "Glossary link: concept identifier") refers to a clinical idea, and not to a specific term used to describe that idea. Therefore, the  _concept identifier_ provides a consistent way to represent a clinical idea in an electronic health record. As illustrated by the following example, SNOMED CT links many terms used to describe a single clinical idea to the same _concept identifier_. This means the same  _concept_ can be entered and/or displayed using any of these terms.

# SNOMED CT Represents Logical Relationships Between Clinical Ideas

The SNOMED CT [subtype hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype+hierarchy "Glossary link: subtype hierarchy") provides logic-based relationships between each  _concept_ and  _concepts_ that represent more general clinical ideas that [subsume](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subsume "Glossary link: subsume") that  _concept_. This feature enables retrieval and analysis using queries that select _concepts_ that are [subtypes](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype "Glossary link: subtypes") of a specified _concept_. For example, to identify all patients who have had a myocardial infarction, a query can search for all patients with a diagnosis of either [ 22298006](http://snomed.info/id/22298006 "22298006 | myocardial infarction \(disorder\) |") or a subtype of that concept (expressed as << [ 22298006](http://snomed.info/id/22298006 "22298006 | myocardial infarction \(disorder\) |") ).

As is illustrated in [Table 3.1.3-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCTXSIG/3.1.3+SNOMED+CT+in+Health+Records#Table-respiratory-diseases-snomed "SNOMED CT Representation of Respiratory Diseases and Infectious Diseases "), the SNOMED CT [subtype hierarchy](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype+hierarchy "Glossary link: subtype hierarchy"), makes it easy to create queries for concepts that are subtypes of a specified more general concept. These types of queries facilitate the delivery of high-quality clinical care by enabling meaning-based reporting, analytics, and decision support. 

Table 3.1.3-1: SNOMED CT Representation of Respiratory Diseases and Infectious Diseases 

**Subtype Hierarchy Design**| **Notes**  
---|---  
All concepts that represent "diseases of the respiratory system" are related to the concept [ 50043002 | Disorder of respiratory system|](http://snomed.info/id/50043002 "50043002 | Disorder of respiratory system |") by a chain of one or more [subtype relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype+relationship "Glossary link: subtype relationships"). | The expression constraint << [ 50043002 | Disorder of respiratory system|](http://snomed.info/id/50043002 "50043002 | Disorder of respiratory system |") returns all concepts that represent "diseases of the respiratory system".  
All concepts that represent "infectious diseases" are related to the concept [ 40733004 | Infectious disease|](http://snomed.info/id/40733004 "40733004 | Infectious disease |") by a chain of one or more [subtype relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype+relationship "Glossary link: subtype relationships"). | The expression constraint << [ 40733004 | Infectious disease|](http://snomed.info/id/40733004 "40733004 | Infectious disease |") returns all concepts that represent "infectious diseases".  
All concepts that represent "infectious diseases of the respiratory system" are related to the concept [ 50043002 | Disorder of respiratory system|](http://snomed.info/id/50043002 "50043002 | Disorder of respiratory system |") by a chain of one or more [subtype relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype+relationship "Glossary link: subtype relationships"), and to the concept [ 40733004 | Infectious disease|](http://snomed.info/id/40733004 "40733004 | Infectious disease |") by another chain of one or more [subtype relationships](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/subtype+relationship "Glossary link: subtype relationships"). | The expression constraint << [ 50043002 | Disorder of respiratory system|](http://snomed.info/id/50043002 "50043002 | Disorder of respiratory system |") AND << [ 40733004 | Infectious disease|](http://snomed.info/id/40733004 "40733004 | Infectious disease |") only returns "infectious diseases of the respiratory system".  
  
# SNOMED CT Expressions Combine Concepts to Represent More Specific Meanings

A [SNOMED CT expression](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+expression "Glossary link: SNOMED CT expression") is a  a structured combination of one or more [concept identifiers](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+identifier "Glossary link: concept identifiers") that represents an idea. 

### Notes

  * An _expression_ containing a single [concept identifier](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+identifier "Glossary link: concept identifier") is referred to as a [precoordinated expression](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/precoordinated+expression "Glossary link: precoordinated expression"). An _expression_ that contains two or more [concept identifiers](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+identifier "Glossary link: concept identifiers") is a [postcoordinated expression](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/postcoordinated+expression "Glossary link: postcoordinated expression").
  * The syntax used to represent  _SNOMED CT expressions_ is called the [SNOMED CT compositional grammar](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+compositional+grammar "Glossary link: SNOMED CT compositional grammar") and is formally defined in the [Compositional Grammar - Specification and Guide](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCSCG/Compositional+Grammar+-+Specification+and+Guide).
  * The [concept identifiers](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept+identifier "Glossary link: concept identifiers") in a [postcoordinated expression](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/postcoordinated+expression "Glossary link: postcoordinated expression") are related to one another in accordance with rules expressed in the [SNOMED CT Concept Model](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/SNOMED+CT+Concept+Model "Glossary link: SNOMED CT Concept Model"). These rules allow an _expression_ to [refine](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/refine "Glossary link: refine") the meaning of a [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept") by applying more specific values to particular attributes of a more general [concept](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/concept "Glossary link: concept").

### Example

  * The  _expression_ 284196006:363698007=770850006 represents a burn to the skin of the left index finger. 

  * An  _expression_ can also include the terms related to each of the identified concepts as shown below:

[ 284196006 |burn of skin|](http://snomed.info/id/284196006 "284196006 | burn of skin |") : [ 363698007 |finding site|](http://snomed.info/id/363698007 "363698007 | finding site |") = [ 770850006 |Skin structure of left index finger|](http://snomed.info/id/770850006 "770850006 | Skin structure of left index finger |")
