# 3.1.1 Free-Text Health Records

In its simplest form, a health record may consist of a chronological series of free-text notes containing terms that represent specific clinical ideas. These terms identify or describe information relevant to the condition, care, and treatment of the _subject of care_. For example, information about symptoms reported by the  _subject of care_ , clinical signs found by a [healthcare professional](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/healthcare+professional "Glossary link: healthcare professional"), diagnostic investigations, diagnoses, therapeutic procedures, and medication prescribed or administered. 

While free-text records enable flexible recording, they have several significant limitations, some of which are summarized in [Table 3.1.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCTXSIG/3.1.1+Free-Text+Health+Records#Table-text-limitations "Limitations of Free-Text Recording"). Sections [3.1.2 Coding Health Records](3.1.2-Coding-Health-Records_278301579.html) and [3.1.3 SNOMED CT in Health Records](3.1.3-SNOMED-CT-in-Health-Records_278301585.html) outline some of how these limitations can be resolved by using coded data to supplement or replace free-text. 

Table 3.1.1-1: Limitations of Free-Text Recording

**Limitation**| **Description**| **Examples**  
---|---|---  
**Synonymy**|  Different terms may be used to refer to precisely the same clinical idea. It is important to recognize all the ways of expressing information relevant to the health of the _subject of care_. | The terms "heart attack", "myocardial infarction", "MI" and "infarction of heart" refer to the same clinical disorder.  
**Language differences**|  Different languages use different words and phrases to refer to the same clinical idea. In a multilingual environment, it is important to represent the underlying meaning rather than just the term in a particular language.| The terms following terms have the same meaning:

  * Myocardial infarction <figure><img src="../../images/154243263" alt="" title=""></figure>__IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_2__
  * Infarto cardíaco <figure><img src="../../images/154243258" alt="" title=""></figure> __IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_4__
  * Infarctus cardiaque <figure><img src="../../images/154243271" alt="" title=""></figure>

  * Hjärtinfarkt <figure><img src="../../images/154243262" alt="" title=""></figure>

  * Hartaanval <figure><img src="../../images/154243266" alt="" title=""><figcaption><p><strong>Ambiguity</strong>|  A term or abbreviation may have more than one meaning. The meaning may be clear based on the context of the note. However, that may not be sufficient to provide certainty of the intended meaning. | The term "<strong>fundus</strong> " - may refer to the:</p></figcaption></figure>

  

  * Fundus of stomach
  * Uterine fundus
  * Fundus of the eye

  
**Abbreviation**|  Use of abbreviations creates additional terms that refer to the same concept. This results in additional synonymous terms and also often leads to ambiguity.| The abbreviation "MI" may refer to:

  * Myocardial infarction
  * Mitral incompetence

  
**Misspelling and word order variation**|  When free-text is used, a word may be misspelled or there may be variations in word order or punctuation in a phrase.| The misspelled entry "mycardiac infarctoin" may not be recognized as an erroneous variant of "myocardial infarction"
