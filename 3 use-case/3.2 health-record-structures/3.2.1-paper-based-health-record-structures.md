# 3.2.1 Paper-Based Health Record Structures

Paper-based health records are typically structured in ways that follow patterns that have been formally defined or established by convention. Some aspects of health record structures are generalizable, while others may be specific to a particular healthcare discipline or specialty. In some cases, standard forms and other paper-based data collection structures may also be recommended, or mandated, by national or regional authorities, healthcare provider organizations, insurers, or funding bodies. These factors result in a wide variety of different paper-based record structures that share some common features noted below.

Individual entries in a record usually include the date or time of recording and, where relevant, dates and times of recorded events and activities may also be included. Similarly, each entry usually includes a signature or some other indication of its attribution. Additional attribution data may include identification of the source of recorded information and those undertaking recorded activities. The clinical content of a record entry may be represented in many different ways. As illustrated in [Table 3.2.1-1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCTXSIG/3.2.1+Paper-Based+Health+Record+Structures#Table-paper-record-stuctures " Common Types of Record Entries in Paper Health Records_CZ:_MZ:_p class_auto-cursor-target_br /_/p_table class_relative-table wrapped style_width_ 99.9452%;_colgroup_ _col style_width_ 21.2836%; /_ _col style_width_ 46.2425%; /_ _col style_width_ 6.5277%; /_ _col style_width_ 8.28305%; /_ _col style_width_ 17.6632%; /_ _/colgroup_tbody_tr_td class_highlight-blue data-highlight-colour_blue rowspan_2_p_br /_/p_p_strong title_Record Entry Type_/strong_/p_/td_td class_highlight-blue data-highlight-colour_blue rowspan_2_p_br /_/p_p_strong title_Description of Record Entry Structure_/strong_/p_/td_td class_highlight-blue colspan_3 data-highlight-colour_blue style_text-align_ center;_strong title_Additional Data _/strong_/td_/tr_tr_td class_highlight-blue colspan_1 data-highlight-colour_blue_strong title_Attribution_/strong_/td_td class_highlight-blue colspan_1 data-highlight-colour_blue_strong title_Ordering_/strong_/td_td class_highlight-blue colspan_1 data-highlight-colour_blue_div class_content-wrapper_p_strong title_Structure and Interpretation_/strong_/p_/div_/td_/tr_tr_td_strong_Narrative text entry_/strong_/td_td_Text notes without any organizing structure other than the date of entry._/td_td colspan_1_ul_li_Author_/li_/ul_/td_td colspan_1_ul_li_Date/time_/li_/ul_/td_td colspan_1_-_/td_/tr_tr_td_strong_Text entries in headed sections_/strong_/td_td_div class_content-wrapper_p_Text notes that are subdivided by the author into sections with headings.
